## Supporting information for paper titled "Functional Tissue Unit in Human Atlas"

- Mapping of human organ data in funtional tissue unit level by creating 2 dimensional visualization.
- Creating a beautiful Butterfly visualization so that people can take picture with it.

  ### iFTU design

- HRA maps human organ data in single cell level by studing functional tissue units and their connecting vasculature.
- Table1: Vasculature pathway to and fro from hear to the FTU.
- Table2: The data set provides information about size and the shape of the FTU.
- Table3 : The data set we have used has 3640 cell types and 21 anatomical structure mapped.

  ### Butterfly Viz

  - A Photo clickable poster that connects all the 22 FTUs of 5th release HRA with vasculature in butterfly design. This has nodes and edges of both female and male organs.
    #### Requirements of code:
    - python
    - jupyter or any editor of preference
    - packages: pyvis , networkx, datashader
